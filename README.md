Hello
In this repository you will find the script run_analysis.R, the README and the codebook for the final project of the
Getting and cleaning Data course offered by the Jonhs Hopkins University in the Coursera platform.

The script shows the different steps to make a tidy data set for the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

This includes the selection only of the variables correspondig to the mean or standard deviation of all the original variables. It also joins the training and testing datasets, maintainig the code of each subject and a column with the activity name.
Finally the scripts create a new tidy data set with the means of all the variables previously selected organized by the different type
of activity and by each experiment subject.

The codebook contains all the information related to the data (contents, structure and layout).
